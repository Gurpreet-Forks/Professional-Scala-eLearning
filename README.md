# Professional Scala [eLearning]
Professional Scala teaches you how to build and contribute to Scala programs, recognizing common patterns and techniques used with the language. You'll learn how to write concise, functional code with Scala. After an introduction to core concepts, syntax, and writing example applications with scalac, you'll learn about the Scala Collections API and how the language handles type safety via static types out-of-the-box. You'll then learn about advanced functional programming patterns, and how you can write your own Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). By the end of the course, you'll be equipped with the skills you need to successfully build smart, efficient applications in Scala that can be compiled to the JVM.


## What you will learn
* Understand the key language syntax and core concepts for application development
* Master the type system to create scalable type-safe applications while cutting down your time spent debugging
* Understand how you can work with advanced data structures via built-in features such as the Collections library
* Use classes, objects, and traits to transform a trivial chatbot program into a useful assistant
* Understand what are pure functions, immutability, and higher-order functions
* Recognize and implement popular functional programming design patterns
